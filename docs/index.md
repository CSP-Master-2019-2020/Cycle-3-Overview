# Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

By now you should be well into your Create Task.

Remember that to complete the Create Performance Task you will:
* Design & implement a small application using App Lab.
* Make a short demo video for your app.
* Complete the written responses about your app.

The Create Task (along with the Explore Task) are the only assessed components for the AP exam this year. As such, I can not give you specific feedback on your ideas or their implementation. However, you can use other resources – pretty much anybody but me – and I can offer general advice and feedback, along the lines of whole class announcements like "make sure that you can show a process in the development of your application."

The deadline for completing all three components and uploading them to your Digital Portfolio is 8:59 PM on Tuesday the 26th of May.

You can find the slides from today’s Zoom session [here]().
